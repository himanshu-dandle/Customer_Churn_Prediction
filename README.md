# Customer Churn Prediction
This project aims to predict customer churn using various machine learning classification models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. The analysis involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation to identify key factors that influence customer churn.

## Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
- **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most important features that contribute to customer churn.
- **Model Training**: Applying multiple classification algorithms to predict churn, with a focus on improving model accuracy and interpretability.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Using cross-validation, accuracy scores, ROC curves, and feature importance plots to evaluate model performance.
- **Visualizations**: Clear visualizations to illustrate feature importance, model performance, and interpretability.

## How to Use:
